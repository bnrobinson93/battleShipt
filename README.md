This is a sample project, created in React to display competency in coding. The game starts initially with 2 ships for each player and is definied using the numShips variable. This can be modified to use more or less ships. The ships are randomly generated and the game begins with player one firing at player two. The player's ships are displayed as grey shapes on the grid and a hit displays red, blue displays a miss. A history is shown on the sidebar and the game will continue until it is either restarted or there is a winner.
